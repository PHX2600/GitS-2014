## GameLogic.dll, DECOMPILED!

ILSpy on Windows, then opening the DLL. It has a "Save Code" feature. Select the
DLL that appeared (not any individual class) and the save feature will output
an entire project structure.

THIS DOESN'T WORK. I appreciate any help.

To run this, open MonoDevelop and point to the GameLogic.sln file. Boom, codes.
